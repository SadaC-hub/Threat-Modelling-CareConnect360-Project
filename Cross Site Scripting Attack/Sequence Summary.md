# Summary MITRE ATT&CK Sequence

### Attack Description

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability found in web applications that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into content delivered to users. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser, compromising the integrity and confidentiality of the user's data.
