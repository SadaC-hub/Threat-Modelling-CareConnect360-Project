# Cross Site Scripting Attack Summary

## Stages of the Attack

### Origins

The attack is initiated by an attacker leveraging a long history of cyber attack techniques. The attacker identifies the Solaris **CareConnect360** application as a target due to its sensitive health data and public-facing nature.

### 1. Reconnaissance
The attacker conducts research to identify vulnerabilities in the **CareConnect360** application. They gather information about the application’s frontend technologies (like React.js) and its user interactions, aiming to pinpoint where XSS vulnerabilities may exist. This may involve inspecting the source code, analyzing how user input is handled, and identifying endpoints that could be susceptible to injection attacks.

### 2. Weaponization
The attacker crafts a malicious payload designed to execute JavaScript in the browser of an unsuspecting user. This payload could be a script that steals cookies, session tokens, or any sensitive information stored in the user's browser. The attacker may also create a phishing email containing a link to a page on **CareConnect360** that contains the crafted payload, designed to lure users into clicking it.

### 3. Delivery
The attacker delivers the malicious payload to potential victims through various means, such as:
- Phishing emails that link to a compromised page of the **CareConnect360** application.
- Posting malicious scripts on forums or social media where users of the application might visit.
- Leveraging social engineering to convince users to click on a link that leads to an XSS exploit.

### 4. Exploitation
Once a user interacts with the malicious link, the crafted JavaScript executes in the context of the **CareConnect360** application. The attacker exploits the vulnerability to execute arbitrary scripts in the user's browser, potentially leading to:
- Theft of session cookies, allowing the attacker to hijack user accounts.
- Manipulation of the DOM to display fraudulent content, tricking users into providing sensitive information.
- Redirecting users to malicious sites that mimic legitimate ones.

### 5. Installation
If the XSS exploit is successful, the attacker can install further malicious payloads within the user's session, such as:
- Backdoors that allow continuous access to the user's account or the application itself.
- Scripts that spread the attack by sending the malicious payload to other users of the application.

### 6. Actions on Objectives
With the attack successfully executed, the attacker can achieve various malicious objectives, including:
- Exfiltrating sensitive data, such as personal health information (PHI), from the user’s account.
- Using the hijacked session to manipulate or tamper with patient records or appointments.
- Deploying further attacks on the **CareConnect360** infrastructure, potentially leading to larger data breaches or service disruptions.
