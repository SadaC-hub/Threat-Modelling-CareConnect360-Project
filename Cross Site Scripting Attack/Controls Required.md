### Controls Required:

- **Input validation and sanitization** to ensure all user inputs are properly checked and cleaned.
  
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)** to define which content sources are trusted and reduce the risk of executing malicious scripts.
  
- **Use of HTTPOnly and Secure flags** for cookies to prevent client-side scripts from accessing sensitive session information.
  
- **Escaping output** to ensure that user-generated content is displayed safely without executing scripts.
  
- **Regular security testing** (e.g., penetration testing) to identify and remediate XSS vulnerabilities in the application.
  
- **Educating developers** on secure coding practices to minimize the introduction of vulnerabilities during the development process.
  
- **Implementation of a Web Application Firewall (WAF)** configured to filter out malicious requests and block common XSS patterns.
  
- **Monitoring and logging** user interactions to detect unusual activities that may indicate XSS attempts.
