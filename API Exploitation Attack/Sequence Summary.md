# Summary MITRE ATT&CK Sequence

### Attack Description

API exploitation occurs when an attacker identifies and exploits vulnerabilities within an application programming interface (API) to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data and functionalities. This can lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, and other malicious activities.

### Methodology

The attack sequence below utilizes the MITRE ATT&CK framework along with commonly used techniques.
