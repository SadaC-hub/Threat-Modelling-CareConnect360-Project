### Controls Required for Mitigating API Exploitation

- **Access Controls** to limit user permissions, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access sensitive API endpoints and functionalities.

- **User Activity Monitoring** to track interactions with the API and detect any suspicious or unauthorized behavior within the **CareConnect360** application.

- **Regular Security Audits** to review API access logs, user activities, and compliance with security policies, helping to identify potential vulnerabilities and exploitation attempts.

- **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)** measures to monitor and restrict the movement of sensitive information through API requests, preventing unauthorized data exfiltration.

- **Education and Training** for employees on recognizing and reporting suspicious API activities, emphasizing the importance of security awareness and best practices.

- **Incident Response Plan** to outline procedures for addressing and mitigating API exploitation threats effectively when detected.

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to ensure users have the minimum necessary access rights to API endpoints, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and actions.

- **Separation of Duties** to minimize the risk of exploitation by ensuring no single individual has complete control over critical API processes, enhancing oversight and accountability.
